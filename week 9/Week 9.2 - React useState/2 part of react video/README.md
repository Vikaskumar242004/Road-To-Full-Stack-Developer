   in my language :-
     
# useffect
   we use useeffect, if we render our setcount function so every render it generates a new clock and our counter is complicated becuase too much clockes are render so we use useeffect function by using this we render our setcount funciton and it render only once

# deifnation of mounting and unmounting

 so basically, the code we write in useEffect is used at the time of mounting and ignored during re-rendring and the function we return in useeffect is called at the time of unmounting
